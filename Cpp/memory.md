The physical memory of your computer. Where all your variables and instructions are stored at runtime. A common tool to read/write from memory is a [[pointer]]. 
Memory can be [[stack]] memory of [[heap]] memory;
In a computer , memory functions like a long array of blocks, in wich each block has an adress. In [[32bit]] architecture (x86), each memory adress is 32bits(4bytes). And in [[64bit]] architecture (x64) , each memory adresss is 64bits(8bytes).
Memory adresses are integers and generally represented in a [[hexadecimal]] base like `00 b8 02 f1`  which translates to 12059377 in decimal.That's the adress of this memory block.
One could also ask about the [[size]] of a memory block.
