## Define
Defines some constant throughtout our code. \#define , use it a top level
## Include
The \#include keyword is used to literally copy and paste text from other files into the current files
Include can be used with " " and <>. The difference is that "" takes paths relative to the path of the file and <> doesnt, the file just has to be inside one of the [[include directories]] , which can be setup for convenience. 
For example \<iostream\> is a header file , it just doesnt have the .h extension per choice of the c++ creators.
## Pragma
The [[pragma]] keyword can be used as  [[header]]  guard with \#pragma once.
## Ifndef , If, EndIF
Used as a conditional to follow some rule if certain conditions are met.
