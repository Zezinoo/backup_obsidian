The compilation of C++ code is a two-fold process, in which the main operations consist of:
- [[Compiling]]
- [[Linking]]
This generates an output file which could be an executable, a dynamic linked library or other formats depending on the instructions given to the compiler
This is often automatized using tools such as [[Cmake]] and [[ninja]], so that the project can be [[built | build]] with the same set of rules everytime.
[[Compilation Time | Compile Time]] is the time the compiler uses to convert the cpp instructions into the binary instructions while [[runtime]] is the time used to effectively run the program.
