When a set of constants is known at compile time and certain operations are made upon then in the source code ( comparisons, maths , etc) the compiler can choose the result of this operations a constant at [[Compilation Time | compile time]] so that this operations don't have to be made at [[runtime]] . This generally speed up execution.
